						This is an academic research project conducted through the University of Pennsylvania. In this game, evidence will appear on screen indicating the location of a source. You're job will be to determine if the evidence suggests the source is above or below the line in the center of the screen. There will be 12 blocks of trials. The task will take about 30 minutes to complete.
